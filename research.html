      <p>
        My research focuses on the valuation of ecosystem services, pollution impacts, and household behavior in environmental decision-making.
        I explore topics such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Valuation of ecosystem services using choice experiments</li>
        <li>Health costs of arsenic contamination in groundwater</li>
        <li>Behavioral economics related to water safety practices in rural India</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Publications include peer-reviewed work in <i>Groundwater for Sustainable Development</i> and presentations at AERE, INSEE, and As2024 conferences.
      </p>
